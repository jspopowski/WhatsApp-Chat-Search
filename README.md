# WhatsApp-Chat-Search
 Python GUI (en fran√ßais) that lets you import a WhatsApp chat history (.txt file), and search that history for either
1. All the times that a specific word/words were said (first search bar),
2. All the messages from a specific date, formatted as JJ/MM/AAAA

Also, you can double-click on any given message, and a window will pop up with the 10 messages before and after it.

I haven't gotten it to work with images yet, that's for the future.

You need some sort of Python 3.x version installed on your computer. You also might need to install an additional package or two. If you get an error saying No such Package while trying to run the script, just open a command prompt or terminal and do a pip install of it
